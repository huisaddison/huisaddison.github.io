## Work Experience
#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - 
* As of July 2017, I have joined Facebook full-time as a Data Scientist.

#### **Data Scientist, OnCorps (Cambridge, MA)** | Summer 2016
* Authored internal R library to rapidly and faithfully visualize
  classification trees via D3.js, with integration into core products and
  services 
* Built pipelines for data aggregation, cleanup, and analysis in R and
  Python 
* Developed and maintained internal and client-facing dashboards in R Shiny
  to monitor product engagement rates and outcomes 

#### **Teaching Fellow, Yale Statistics; CS** | Jan. 2016 - May 2017
* Held office hours for STAT 230, an introduction to the R statistical language
  through applications in inference, simulation, model selection, $k$-means,
  PCA, and other methods.
* Served in a teaching and grading role for 'Computational Tools for Data
  Science', covering optimization, dimensionality reduction, clustering,
  dictionary learning, matrix factorization, large-scale data, etc., with
  applications in Python and Spark.
* Provided supplementary instruction for 'Introduction to Information Systems',
  taught in R and Python 

## Research Experience
#### **Research Assistant, Yale Dept. of Statistics** | Aug. 2016 - May 2017
* Investigated minimax convergence rates for estimation of bandable precision
  matrices.
* Implemented approximations to second-order optimization algorithms (e.g.,
  sketched Newton) in distributed settings.

#### **Research Assistant, Yale Inst. for Network Sci.** | Aug. 2015 - May 2016
* Wrote pruning and local clustering algorithms based on novel research (C++)
* Data cleanup and analysis in R and Python 

## Projects
* [Latent Variable Inference with Factor Graphs](pdfs/LatentVariableInferenceWithFactorGraphs.pdf):
  term project for STAT 667, a graduate-level course on probabilistic graphical
  models.  
* [newton-sketch](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch): Implementation of [Newton Sketch: A Linear-time Optimization Algorithm with Linear-Quadratic Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02250)
  in NumPy and Spark.
