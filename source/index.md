## Experience
#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - 
* As of July 2017, I have joined Facebook full-time as a Data Scientist.

#### **Research Assistant, Yale Dept. of Statistics** | Aug. 2016 - May 2017
* Investigated minimax convergence rates for estimation of bandable precision
  matrices.
* Implemented approximations to second-order optimization algorithms (e.g.,
  sketched Newton) in distributed settings.

#### **Teaching Fellow, Yale Statistics; CS** | Jan. 2016 - May 2017
* Served in grading and supplemental teaching roles for various courses in
  the Statistics and Computer Science Departments, covering material including
  inference, model selection, optimization, dimensionality reduction,
  dictionary learning, matrix factorization, etc., with applications in
  R, Python, and Spark.

#### **Research Assistant, Yale Inst. for Network Sci.** | Aug. 2015 - May 2016
* Wrote pruning and local clustering algorithms based on novel research (C++)
* Data cleanup and analysis in R and Python
