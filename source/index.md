## Experience

#### **Research Assistant, Yale Dept. of Statistics** | Aug. 2016 - May 2017
* Investigated minimax convergence rates for estimation of bandable precision
  matrices.  Work appeared in [NIPS 2017.](
  http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7074-minimax-estimation-of-bandable-precision-matrices)
  Journal version on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07006).
* [Implemented approximations](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch)
  to second-order optimization algorithms (e.g., sketched Newton) in
  distributed settings.

#### **Teaching Fellow, Yale Statistics; CS** | Jan. 2016 - May 2017
* Served in grading and supplemental teaching roles for various courses in
  the Statistics and Computer Science Departments, covering material including
  inference, model selection, optimization, dimensionality reduction,
  dictionary learning, matrix factorization, etc., with applications in
  R, Python, and Spark.

#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - August 2018
* Worked on Search Core Relevance.
