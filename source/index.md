## About

I am a fifth-year PhD student pursuing a joint degree in the Departments
of [Statistics](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html)
and [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.  I am
lucky to be advised by [Ryan Tibshirani](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/).

Beginning Fall 2022, I am a visiting student researcher at the
[Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley.

## Awards

I am grateful to be supported by an
[NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) award in
Mathematical Statistics.

## Projects

#### [**Epidemic tracking and forecasting**](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/)
In March 2020, I joined the Carnegie Mellon University's
[Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu) on an emergency basis to aid in
Covid-19 tracking and forecasting.  During that time, I helped develop and
wrote core pipelines for [real-time Covid-19
indicators](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111452118),
which were made available to the general public.  We also used
these indicators to produce
[Covid-19 forecasts](https://zoltardata.com/model/307).

Since Summer 2021, I have stepped back into a contributor role,
occasionally assisting with projects.  In
Fall 2021 I helped produce [influenza
forecasts](https://github.com/cdcepi/Flusight-forecast-data/tree/master/data-forecasts/CMU-TimeSeries)
for the 2021-2022 flu season, which we submitted to [CDC
FluSight](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html).

#### [**newton-sketch**](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch)
An [implementation](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch) of [Newton
Sketch: A Linear-time Optimization Algorithm with Linear-Quadratic
Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02250) in NumPy and Spark.

## Professional Experience

#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - August 2018
I worked on Search Core Relevance, specifically an element of the Facebook
search engine responsible for retrieving specific posts previously seen by
a user.
