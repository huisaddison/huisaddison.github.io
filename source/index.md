## Projects

#### [**COVIDcast**](https://covidcast.cmu.edu)
* Since March 2020, I have temporarily
  joined [Delphi](https://covidcast.cmu.edu/) to aid in COVID-19 forecasting.

  incident deaths and cases, respectively.  See them
  [here](https://zoltardata.com/model/307).

#### [**newton-sketch**](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch)
* [Implementation](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch) of
  [Newton Sketch: A Linear-time Optimization Algorithm with Linear-Quadratic
  Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02250)
  in NumPy and Spark.

## Professional Experience

#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - August 2018
