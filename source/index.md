## Experience
#### **Data Scientist, Facebook Seattle** | July 2017 - 
* As of July 2017, I have joined Facebook full-time as a Data Scientist.  I
  work on Search.

#### **Research Assistant, Yale Dept. of Statistics** | Aug. 2016 - May 2017
* Investigated minimax convergence rates for estimation of bandable precision
  matrices.  Work appeared in [NIPS 2017.](
  http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7074-minimax-estimation-of-bandable-precision-matrices)
  Journal version on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07006).
* [Implemented approximations](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch)
  to second-order optimization algorithms (e.g., sketched Newton) in
  distributed settings.

#### **Teaching Fellow, Yale Statistics; CS** | Jan. 2016 - May 2017
* Served in grading and supplemental teaching roles for various courses in
  the Statistics and Computer Science Departments, covering material including
  inference, model selection, optimization, dimensionality reduction,
  dictionary learning, matrix factorization, etc., with applications in
  R, Python, and Spark.

## Publications
* Addison Hu and Sahand Negahban.  [Minimax Estimation of Bandable Precision
  Matrices.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07006)  _Advances in Neural
  Information Processing Systems_, 2017.

## Projects
* [Latent Variable Inference with Factor Graphs](
  pdfs/LatentVariableInferenceWithFactorGraphs.pdf):
  term project for STAT 667, a graduate-level course on probabilistic graphical
  models.  
* [newton-sketch](https://github.com/huisaddison/newton-sketch): Implementation of
  [Newton Sketch: A Linear-time Optimization Algorithm with Linear-Quadratic
  Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02250)
  in NumPy and Spark.
