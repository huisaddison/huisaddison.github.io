## About

I am a Visiting Scientist at [Latitude AI](lat.ai), where I work an project
drawing on concepts from off-policy evaluation and causal inference to
better guide the development of the self-driving stack.  

In November 2023, I received a PhD
in [Statistics](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html)
and 
[Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) from Carnegie Mellon University,
where
I was lucky to be advised by [Ryan Tibshirani](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/).
I spent the final year and a half of graduate school as a visiting researcher
at the
[UC Berkeley Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). 
Prior to all this, I received a BS in Statistics from Yale University and spent
some time working at Facebook.

## Interests

My work touches on statistical methodology, nonparametric theory, and
optimization.  My main focus at this time is understanding the use of **total
variation penalties in the scattered data, d-dimensional setting**, which can be
thought of as a multivariate generalization of locally adaptive regression
splines or trend filtering.  My collaborators and I have provided a treatment
of the [zeroth-order case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14514), and we are
currently working on the first-order case.  In each of these projects, I
consider the estimation problem from different angles: statistical rates,
efficient computation, practical usage.

I also have an applied interest in **computational epidemiology**.
At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I joined CMU's
[Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu) on an emergency basis
to help produce [real-time Covid-19
indicators](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111452118)
and [forecasts](https://zoltardata.com/model/307).  I found the work compelling
enough to continue working on related problems, including [forecasting
influenza](https://github.com/cdcepi/Flusight-forecast-data/tree/master/data-forecasts/CMU-TimeSeries)
for [CDC
FluSight](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html).
