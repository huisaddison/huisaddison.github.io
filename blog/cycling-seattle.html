		<p>I recently picked up a used bicycle off Craigslist.  It's a beautiful
steel Schwinn from the 1980s.  </p>
<p>I take it out on joyrides pretty often, and it's an indispensable part
of my daily commute now.  Prior to this I've never cycled regularly.</p>

<h2>Riding along Burke Gilman</h2>
<p>My favorite ride to take on a weekend afternoon is the Burke Gilman from
Fremont to its end in Bothell.</p>

<p>192 Brewing lies along the trail, near Kenmore.  It's a nice place to have
a drink and relax for a while before heading home.  </p>
<p>Sunday afternoons feature live blues.</p>

<h2>Riding along the Ship Canal Trail</h2>
<p>For a nice, quick ride after work, I head in the opposite direction, along
the Ship Canal Trail towards Discovery Park.  A fantastic viewpoint exists
there, by the Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center.</p>

<p>The area is almost always unoccupied.  It's particularly nice for clearing
one's head.  </p>
<p>The first time I stopped by, I was reminded of a line
from my favorite children's book series.  "The world is quiet here."</p>
