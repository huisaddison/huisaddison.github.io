        <section>
		<p>I recently went on a hike with some friends to Snow Lake in Snolquamie Pass.
It was a wonderful time.  We started early and made it to Snow Lake before it
became crowded.  The water was clear (the smoky skies not so much) and we
jumped into the water for a quick swim (it would have been nice to stay longer,
but the lake was sixty degrees Fahrenheit at most, and not particularly
inviting).  </p>
<p>From there, we hiked the extra mile or so to Gem Lake and made our way back.
This photograph, my favorite, is of Gem Lake.</p>

<p>Here are the other pictures from the hike.</p>

<p>These photographs were taken with a Ricoh GR II -- the film photography habit,
as one may have guessed, required too much dedication to stick :P</p>
